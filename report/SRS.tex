	\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
	Purpose of this document is to describe Chat Service System. This paper will explain the key features of the system, as well as set of interfaces of the system, what the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli, by presenting the general structure and a set of specific use cases. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system.
	\subsection{Scope of project}
	This system is a simple messaging that allows users to register a nickname and post a message that's bundled with such identifier. The system consists of a RESTFul service, a PostgreSQL database and a web-browser Single-Page Application. Database contains messages, users, and active sessions. User's session is defined by a pair of the authentication token and nickname stored in data base, that user is provided as a result of authentication process. User's nickname is bundled to the message through the process of verification of authentication token, that retrieves the respective nickname.

	\section{Overall description}
	\subsection{System enviroment}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SystemEnviroment.png}
	RESTFul service consists of two controllers --- Authentication that hands out tokens, and Messaging that puts messages in DB and loads last 50. All users communicate through HTTP requests to specific parts of the server application, for example, /load to load messages
	\subsection{Functional requirement specification}
	This section outlines the use cases for each of the active readers separately. The reader has one use case, the author and the member have three and new user has to go through the process of registration, which is his fourth use case. This paper will present a chart of each user's interaction with requests to REST, and a diagram showcasing the process of each request
	\subsubsection{/load}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Reader.png} \\
	Loads messages from database.\\
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{loadDiagram.png}
	\subsubsection{/register}
	Checks nickname and login availability, then registers user's desired credentials\\
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{registerDiagram.png}
	\subsubsection{/auth}
	Authenticates the user and generates authentication token that's associated with user's nickname.\\
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{authDiagram.png}
	\subsubsection{/send}
	Retrieves nickname associated with user's token, and bundles it to the message before posting it to database.\\

	\subsection{Non-Functional requirements}
	The chat service can be installed on a server via on-Premise deployment, given a postgresql database and server are configured beforehand.
